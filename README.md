# My Portfolio
https://jubabelhocine.com

This is my personal portfolio built with **React** and styled entirely with **pure CSS**. I designed the entire layout in **Figma** and integrated the mockup into the project, which deepened my understanding of modern CSS techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building a dynamic user interface.
- **Pure CSS:** For all styling, emphasizing fundamentals like Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design.
- **Figma:** For designing and prototyping the entire layout.

## What I Learned

- Translating a Figma design into a fully functional website.
- Advanced CSS techniques and responsive design without external frameworks.
- Best practices in UI/UX design and implementation.
